      <li> Apple becomes the first 1 Trillion Dollar Company</li>
      <p>Apple just became the first company to be worth $1 trillion on the public markets.The <strong>milestone</strong> was crossed when Apple's <strong>stock</strong> hit $207.05 share, and comes just days after Apple reported its third quarter <strong>fiscal</strong> earnings. Those earnings beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines, but iPhone sales fell slightly short.
        Apple's fast-growing services business —which includes Apple Music, iCloud, and the App Store — as well as strong hints that a new iPhone launch is in the cards for the coming months, appears to have bolstered investor confidence.
        Meanwhile, rivals like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google's parent company Alphabet also appear to be on the fast-track to $1 trillion, meaning that Apple will likely have some company in this club.
        It's rumored that Apple is expected to launch three new iPhones this fall — a second generation iPhone X, an iPhone X with a larger 6.5-inch screen, and a lower-cost iPhone model with a 6.1-inch screen. The two X models are expected to have <i>OLED</i> screens, while the cheaper model is rumored to have an <i>LCD</i> screen.Apple's fast-growing services business —which includes Apple Music, iCloud, and the App Store — as well as strong hints that a new iPhone launch is in the cards for the coming months, appears to have <strong>bolstered</strong>investor confidence.</p>
      <li>San Francisco looks to ban Free lunches at Tech Companies</li>
      <p>Lavish free lunches are the stuff of Silicon Valley, and a treasured perk in the roster of on-campus benefits that tech companies use to lure workers. But two San Francisco <strong>legislators</strong> are looking forward to taking it away, saying it hurts local businesses who can't compete, reports CBS San Francisco.
        On the other hand, when Square,closes its cafeteria every other Friday, Corridor sees such a <strong>surge</strong> it sometimes has to increase its staffing, said the San Francisco Chronicle. San Francisco Supervisors Ahsha Safai and Aaron Peskin introduced <strong>legislation</strong> on Tuesday prohibiting in-house cafeterias in new office buildings and tech campuses. They insist the city has the legal right to do this through a zoning <strong>amendment</strong> using certain planning and public health codes. "This is the beginning of a conversation," said Safai. "We think it's an appropriate conversation to have now." If passed, this new law would only apply to new companies, not existing companies in the city like Google, Twitter and Levi Strauss & Co.

      <li> San Francisco allows Non-Documented Immigrants to Vote.</li>
      <p> The new <strong>provision</strong> in San Francisco, which voters approved in a 2016 <strong>referendum</strong>, 
        expires after 2022 unless the city decides to extend it. Noncitizens, including those without legal status, can vote only in a school board races and only if they are parents, legal guardians, or caregivers to children under the age of 19. 
        The new measure also has become a topic in the race for governor in California. Adam Putnam, the <strong>GOP</strong> candidate for governor, criticized both San Francisco and Takoma Park in a tweet this week for "allowing illegals to vote." 
        "The right to vote should not be allowed or practiced by anyone who was not born in our country or who has not taken the necessary, legalrequired steps to become a citizen of our nation,” he wrote in a article last year. "This right is too precious to grant to those who have not earned it." He said, 
        In San Francisco, newly eligible voters who are not citizens use a separate form to register that includes a printed warning that their information will be accessible by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and recommending that they consider consulting an immigration attorney before signing up.
