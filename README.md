      <li> $1 trillion market cap Apple says a big swing in a behind-the-scenes tech pricing will boost future earnings</li>
      <p>Apple just became the first company to be worth $1 trillion on the public markets.The milestone was crossed when Apple's stock hit $207.05 share, and comes just days after Apple reported its third quarter fiscal earnings. Those earnings beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines, but iPhone sales fell slightly short.
        Apple's fast-growing services business —which includes Apple Music, iCloud, and the App Store — as well as strong hints that a new iPhone launch is in the cards for the coming months, appears to have bolstered investor confidence.
        Meanwhile, rivals like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google parent company Alphabet also appear to be on the fast-track to $1 trillion, meaning that Apple will likely soon have some company in this club.
        It's rumored that Apple is expected to launch three new iPhones this fall — a second generation iPhone X, an iPhone X with a larger 6.5-inch screen, and a lower-cost iPhone model with a 6.1-inch screen. The two X models are expected to have OLED screens, while the cheaper model is rumored to have an LCD screen.</p>
      <li>San Francisco looks to ban Free lunches at Tech Companies</li>
      <p>Lavish free lunches are the stuff of Silicon Valley, and a treasured perk in the roster of on-campus benefits that tech companies use to lure workers. But two San Francisco legislators are looking to do away with the practice, saying it hurts local businesses who can't compete, reports CBS San Francisco.
         "We see thousands of employees in a block radius that don't go out to lunch and don't go out in support of restaurants every day," said  Ryan Corridor, owner of Corridor, a restaurant blocks from San Francisco's city hall. "It's because they don't have to." On the other hand, when Square, a nearby payment processing company, closes its cafeteria every other Friday, Corridor sees such a surge it sometimes has to increase its staffing, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. "You can't compete with free. Free food is a wonderful amenity but doesn't do anything to extend the community around it," said Gwyneth Borden, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association.
         San Francisco Supervisors Ahsha Safai and Aaron Peskin introduced legislation Tuesday prohibiting in-house cafeterias in new office buildings and tech campuses. They insist the city has the legal right to do this through a zoning amendment using certain planning and public health codes.San Francisco Supervisors Ahsha Safai and Aaron Peskin introduced legislation Tuesday prohibiting in-house cafeterias in new office buildings and tech campuses. They insist the city has the legal right to do this through a zoning amendment using certain planning and public health codes."This is the beginning of a conversation," said Safai. "We think it's an appropriate conversation to have now." If passed, this new law would only apply to new companies, not existing companies in the city like Google, Twitter and Levi Strauss & Co. There are currently 51 such employee cafeterias in San Francisco. Safai painted the measure as a boon to work-life balance. "This is also about a cultural shift," he told the Chronicle. "We don't want employees biking or driving into their office, staying there all day long and going home. This is about getting people out of their office," he said.
         While unusual, the law does have a precedent. In nearby Mountain View, local legislators barred Facebook from fully subsidizing on-site meals for 2,000 workers in the tech company's new offices, according to the Chronicle. It's an attempt to avoid the problem of empty streets and struggling restaurants that has plagued some parts of Silicon Valley. (Employers are allowed to pay for worker meals off-campus. of course.)
         "If we have all these restaurants, we want this to be a successful development. If employers pay for it, that's fine," Michael Kasperzak, a former Mountain View mayor,

      <li> San Francisco allows Non-Documented Immigrants to Vote.</li>
      <p> The new provision in San Francisco, which voters approved in a 2016 referendum, 
        expires after 2022 unless the city decides to extend it. Noncitizens, including those without legal status, can vote only in school board races and only if they are parents, legal guardians, or caregivers to children under the age of 19. 
        The new measure also has become a topic in the race for governor in California. Adam Putnam, the GOP candidate for governor, criticized both San Francisco and Takoma Park in a tweet this week for "allowing illegals to vote." 
        "The right to vote  should not be allowed or practiced by anyone who was not born in our country or who has not taken the necessary, legally required steps to become a citizen of our nation,” he wrote in an op-ed article last year. "This right is too  precious to grant to those who have not earned it." 
        In San Francisco, newly eligible voters who are not citizens use a separate form to register that includes a printed warning that their information will be accessible by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and recommending that they consider consulting an immigration attorney before signing up. 
        That could potentially deter households with undocumented immigrants from participating, even if eligible.
